You can reach the database [here](https://mega.nz/file/eo9VHLRT#MFZRQKcUySyg1H9q3-9IgcS0T6OBx-kBcgE1z7RrPZ0). It contains 6 different classes of prohibitory traffic signs. It was compiled from the [GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html) and [TSRD](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html) databases. It is already split into a training and testing dataset. Preprocessing and data augmentation are needed, these are just the raw source files.
